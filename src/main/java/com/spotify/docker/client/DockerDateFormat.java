/**
 * Docker returns timestamps with nanosecond precision
 * (e.g. <tt>2014-10-17T21:22:56.949763914Z</tt>),
 * but {@link Date} only supports milliseconds. Creating a Date from the nanosecond timestamp
 * results in the date being set to several days after what date should be. This class converts the
 * timestamp from nanoseconds to milliseconds by removing the last six digits of the timestamp, so
 * we can generate a Date with the correct value (albeit with less precision).
 *
 * Note: a more complete solution would be to introduce a custom date type which can store the
 * nanosecond value in an additional field, so users can access the complete value. Or just use Java
 * 8 which has date objects with nanosecond support.
